# NYC Air Quality Analysis (2008-2023)

🚧 **Work in Progress** - This project is actively being developed

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 15+ years of New York City air quality data to identify pollution trends, examine the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on air quality, and compare pollution levels across different neighborhoods.

## Key Findings (So Far)

### 1. Long-Term Trends (2008-2023)
- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)**: Decreased by ~47% (major improvement from cleaner vehicles)
- **Fine Particles (PM 2.5)**: Decreased by ~33% (improved air quality from regulations)
- **Ozone (O3)**: Increased slightly, likely due to rising temperatures from climate change

### 2. COVID-19 Impact (2019-2021)
- **NO2 dropped 11%** during 2020 lockdown (less traffic)
- **PM 2.5 dropped 11.8%** during 2020 lockdown (reduced activity)
- **Ozone remained stable** (complex atmospheric chemistry)
- Pollution levels began returning to normal in 2021 as NYC reopened

### 3. Neighborhood Disparities
- **Cleanest areas**: Rockaways and coastal neighborhoods (ocean breezes)
- **Most polluted areas**: Midtown Manhattan and Chelsea (heavy traffic and congestion)
- Shows clear link between urban density and air pollution

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **Google Colab** for analysis
- **Data Source**: NYC Open Data - Air Quality Dataset

## What's Next
- [ ] Power BI dashboard for interactive visualizations
- [ ] Seasonal pattern analysis
- [ ] Time series forecasting
- [ ] Complete neighborhood-level analysis

## About This Project
This is an independent portfolio project demonstrating data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills. Created by Justin Martinez, Data Analytics student at Syracuse University.
